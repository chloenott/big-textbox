# Big Textbox
<img src="Non-essential/rounded-corner-icon.png" width="100">
Big Textbox is an unreleased iOS app that displays editable, very-large text on the screen. It is my first app.

The purpose of this app is be able to type a message in the editor, then display the large text version to another person so they can read it easily from a distance.

- Font size stays big but reduces as needed to fit all the text on one screen.
- When the editing area slides into view from the top, the big textbox area simultaneously blurs out of focus.
- When the editor is blank, "tap to open editor" displays as the big text placeholder.
- Icon was made to represent the function of the app: shows big text on a phone screen.
